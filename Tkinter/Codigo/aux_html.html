**Assigning output filepath tokens to collections**

By clicking/shift+clicking on the token buttons, you can assign token keys to different collections. Then, in the output filepath window, you can use the tokens to incorporate the desired collection names in the output filepath.

Collection tokens have the form [COLLECTION][_key_] where key is a letter from A to E for manually set token keys.
For example, the first time you click a token button an A will appear.
This means that, if you introduce [COLLECTION][A] to the output pattern in the output filepath window, it will get replaced by the corresponding collection name for all selected jobs
